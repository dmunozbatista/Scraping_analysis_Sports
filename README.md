# Scraping and Analyzing Sports data ⚽️

## Scraping

Using Xpath build functions to retrieve football soccer information from fbref.com. Although I built them to analyze La Liga they work to retrieve data of any league

## Cleaning

We have to clean all the data and also create new variables to do the desired analysis. Starting from building data structures convinient to transform them into dataframes

## Plots

la_liga_forwards.py file has the code to do two different plots to show that Lamine Yamal (Barcelona player) has an outstanding performance and even more considering he is only 16 years old. I have further analysis comparing him to past young stars and his current stats agains his teammates. If you want to see the code please reach out. I did the plots using matplotlib and seaborn

## Intuition

The plots show the carries per player and the expected goals they produced (some show totals and others show per game stats). Lamine Yamal is at the top using any specification. He is also better than past young stars even being a few years younger, and is clearly the best attacking player of FC Barcelona.
